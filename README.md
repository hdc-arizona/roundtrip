## Roundtrip

An library for loading Javascript into Jupyter
Notebooks. Supports transferring data from Python Jupyter cells to Javascriptâ€”and back.

- [Getting Started](#Try-It-Out)
- [Wiki](https://github.com/hdc-arizona/roundtrip/wiki)


### Try It Out
1) Install [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) & [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2) Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hdc-arizona/roundtrip.git
```
3) Run the automatic installer:
```bash
cd roundtrip
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
4) Start a jupyter server from the `roundtrip` base directory:
```bash
jupyter notebook 
```
5) From your web browser navigate to the `docs/examples/` folder and open the `Manual Workflow Example` notebook.

On load, you may need to clean the output by running `Restart & Clear Output`
from the `Kernel` menu in Jupyter.

Running the cells in the first example will demonstrate:

1. The loading of a real pandas dataset into a javascript visualization
2. Interaction with the visualization
3. Returning data back from the visualization to the Jupyter notebook

Once you understand the functionality in this notebook please open the `Advanced Workflow Example`

Running the cells in this example will demonstrate:
1. The `?` operator and how it links python data with visualization data
2. How the `?` can provide linked-view functionality between cells
3. How the linking of data and automatic updating of cells can be easily turned off by removing the `?`
4. How cells update when data is update inside the jupyter notebook as well as in the visualizations
